# IceCreamery Web App
The *iceCreamery* project creates the *Ice Creamery* web application, a Java webapp that runs in a Java application server. Code development is done in Eclipse and Tomcat v10.
The app can be used to create and compare multiple iterations of ice cream recipes.
Any recipe can be created, though special focus is on use of stabilizers, emulsifiers and sweeteners in the pursuit of smoother, creamier ice creams.
