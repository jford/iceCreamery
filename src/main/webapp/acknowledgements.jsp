			I started this quest with what the New York Times labeled their Master Ice Cream 
			Recipe&mdash;a base of 2 parts heavy cream to one part whole milk, 2/3 part (by volume) sugar,  
			1/2 teaspoon salt, and 6 large egg yolks for each 1 1/2 pints of milk/cream mixture. Plus flavorings.
			</p>
			<p>
			I made it with vanilla extract, and it tasted pretty good.
			</p>
			<p>
			But, as the NYTimes author pointed out, there is quite a 
			bit of flexibility in number of eggs&mdash;anywhere from two to eight per pint of ice cream. They 
			recommended staring with six. I used four. That was a somewhat arbitrary decision, and I immediately 
			wondered, why four? Why not two? What would that do to the results? 
			</p>
			<p>
			That broad range of quantity for a basic ingredient started me off on an internet search to find out. 
			</p>
			<p>The Ice Creamery is the result.
