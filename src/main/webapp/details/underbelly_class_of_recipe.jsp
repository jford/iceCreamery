		<p>
		Of all the websites I visited in my search for ice cream wisdom, the one site that 
		stands out as the single most informative and helfpul resource is 
		the <a href="https://underbelly-nyc.blogspot.com/2016/05/ice-cream-series.html">Underbelly blog</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
		To be sure, Underbelly did not invent ice cream, nor, to the best of my knowledge, did the blog 
		author(s) invent the techniques they describe nor did they discover new gums and emulsifiers for the making of 
		ice cream. Or maybe they did and I'm just not aware of the details.
		</p>
		<p>
		But their blog presents a comprehensive, intelligent&mdash;and intelligible (though complex)&mdash;discussion of all these things and more, and they present an impressive  
		collection of results with extremely detailed accounts of what was used, how the ice cream was made, and how it turned out.
		</p>
		<p>		
        I'll be using the Underbelly <a href="https://underbelly-nyc.blogspot.com/2016/05/basic-ice-cream-recipe-examples.html">Standar Base</a> 
		recipe as the starting place for my own ice cream experiments. And so, for the purposes of this blog discussion, 
		I may occasionaly use Underbelly as short hand for the ice cream I'm going to be making.

		My blog, my rules.
