		My choice for an ice cream machne: The Cuisinart ICE-20.

			The Cuisinart ICE-20, predecessor of the ICE-21.

		<p>
		There are more sophistciated, 
		more technologically advanced, and, frankly, more costly machines to be had, but the ICE-20 
		is a low cost, well-reviewed machine made by a respected manufacturer of kitchen appliances, and 
		it works well enough for my purposes. 
		</p>
		<p>
		It's also no longer available.
		</p>
		<p>But...it's descendent, the ICE-21, appears to be a near twin.
		</p>
		<div class="text_note">
		<p>
		Without having bought the newer model, I can't be 100 percent sure, but the only significant 
		difference appears to be the shape of the paddle&mdash;the plastic rectangular piece 
		that sits inside the ice cream bowl, held stationary by the clear plastic cover while 
		the bowl and ice cream base inside swirl around it. 
		</p>
		<p>  
		The older model paddle has an upside down L-shaped inner piece, compared to the straight-across 
		piece in the newer model.
		</p>
		<p>
		This configuration is said to be better at churning the ingredients in such a way as to 
		inhibit the growth of ice crystals.
		</p>
		<p>
		It also looks to me that the new and old paddles are interchangeable, which means I 
		could purchase a new paddle without buying a whole new machine. I haven't done so yet (as of August 31, 2018), 
		but I may, if for no other reason than to verify my theory about the paddle being the 
		only significant difference, as well as the proposition (obtained through reading several reveiw site's 
		assertions).
