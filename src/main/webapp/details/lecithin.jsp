		<p class="text_note">Lecithin can be derived from various sources; two common variations are 
		soy and sunflower lecithin.
		<br/><br/>
		Both varieties can be found in the form of dietary supplement capsules, which can easily be opened
		and the contents squeezed out for use as an ice cream emulsifier.</p>
		<p>Lecithin is one of those ingredients that set off alarm bells in fearful traditionalists' overwrought imaginations. 
		</p>
		<p>It's an unfamiliar, sciencey term that doesn't seem at home in a home cook's kitchen.  
		</p>
		<p>
		But...it is.
		</p>
		<p>Very much so. It's the fat found in, among other things, egg yolks that makes ice cream 
		smooth, creamy and feel good on the tongue.
		</p>
		<p>
		Lecithin is a part of any ice cream that contains an egg yolk, but the whole yoke is not necessary. 
		</p>
		<p>
		In fact none of the yolk is necessary. Lecithin is also found in, and extracted from, soy beans.
		</p>
		<p> 
		Soy lecithin is a common substitute for egg yolks in ice cream, and is what I'll be using in many of the 
		recipes in the Ice Creamery database.
