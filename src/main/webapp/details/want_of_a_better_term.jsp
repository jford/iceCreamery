		For Want of a Better Term

		<div class="text">
		<p>
		The use of the specialized, and unfamiliar, ingredients in the ice cream recipes 
		that don't fall into the traditional ingredients camp (gums, extracts) seems to place the recipes in the general 
		area that has come to be known as <i></i>molecular gastronomy</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
		But it doesn't feel quite right. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The recipes I'm seeing and plan to use don't veer off into the weeds of exotic synthetic 
		chemical additives like carboxymethyl cellulose, or plysorbate 80. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The ingredients I will be using may be unfamiliar to many American cooks: locust bean gum, guar 
		gum, carrogeenan. But they are all natural extracts of foods that have been used in various cultures 
		for centuries, millienia in fact, as opposed to the synthetic ingredients that were created in a chemistry lab.
		</p>
		<p>
		And so, I have a resistance to using the term <i>molecular gastronomy</i> in reference to 
		the things I will be doing.
		</p>
		<p>
		Not that I am opposed to chemistry. I may want tp try some of those synthetics after I get some experience in the 
		ice cream arts. But for now, for the most part, not so much.
